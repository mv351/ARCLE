**Inspiration:**
ARCLE, Augmented Reality Classroom Learning Experience, was born out of a passion for making education exciting and available to everyone, especially those who might face hurdles attending regular classes. This includes students with disabilities to those who simply donâ€™t have access to school. By utilizing the technology of Augmented Reality (AR), ARCLE brings the classroom straight to students, making learning inclusive and awesome. Our mission? To empower students with disabilities, making education an immersive and interactive experience, no matter where they are.

**What it does:**
ARCLE is your ticket to a journey of fun, through the wonders of the sciences. Imagine diving into a 3D cell, exploring the Solar System and getting to walk through for an immersive experience. In the chemistry module, you get to play mad scientist with virtual experiments, witnessing chemical reactions unfold right before your eyes. Brace yourself for STEM learning like never before!

**How we built it:**
ARCLE is the product of our code made using Swift, the language of choice for iOS application development. We have magic within the Xcode realm, using ARKit to bring STEM subjects to life on your mobile devices. Our secret? Interactive 3D models, slick user interfaces, and performance optimization for seamless AR adventures. Debugging and refining happened in real-time, thanks to our iPhone-MacBook duo.

**Challenges we ran into:**
One of the main challenges we faced during development was optimizing the performance of ARCLE to ensure smooth and responsive interactions on mobile devices. Another major obstacle we faced in the creation of ARCLE was user input compatibility. Furthermore, finding and creating accurate 3D models of cells and chemical compounds required extensive research and attention to detail. 

**Accomplishments that we're proud of:**
We're proud to have created an educational tool that has the potential to revolutionize STEM education and inspire the next generation of innovators. ARCLE represents an achievement in leveraging AR technology to enhance learning outcomes and make immersive learning more accessible and engaging for students worldwide.

**What we learned:**
Through the development of ARCLE, we gained valuable insights into the potential of augmented reality as a transformative tool for education. We learned about the technical challenges and considerations involved in creating immersive AR experiences and the importance of user-centric design in educational software.

**What's next for ARCLE:**
Moving forward, we plan to continue refining and expanding ARCLE to cover several other topics and grade levels. We also aim to integrate feedback from educators and students to improve the usability and effectiveness of the platform. Ultimately, our goal is to establish ARCLE as a leading educational resource for STEM learning, empowering students to explore the wonders of learning in an engaging and interactive way.
